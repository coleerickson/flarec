Timeline:

First third:
Get familiar programming in OCaml
Implement regular expression matching algorithms in OCaml using an interpreted approach
    Implement the approaches described in the Russ Cox article
Research and select a unit testing framework for the in-development compiler
Implement Flare matching algorithms in OCaml using an interpreted approach
Learn how to use parsers and parser generators

Second third:
Learn about LLVM and the associated intermediate representation
      Study the following compiler phases in the Appel textbook, implementing and testing each phase as I go
        Abstract syntax
    Semantic actions
    Intermediate representations
    Instruction selection
    Register allocation
It may be useful to start by implementing these phases for regular expressions since they are a simpler version of Flare

Final third:
Register allocation
Instruction selection
